**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2025-07-02 15:35

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Template Search Slider State Management Issue
**Problem:** Slider would jump back to previous value on first slide attempt
**Root Cause:** State management feedback loop between session state and slider component
**Solution:** 
- Implemented proper change detection logic
- Added `on_change` callbacks to prevent feedback loops
- Only update session state when values actually change
- Added proper value mapping between session and display values

#### 2. ✅ GPU Detection Issue  
**Problem:** GPUs not detected despite being available (2x RTX 2080 Ti)
**Root Cause:** PyTorch installed without CUDA support
**Solution:**
- Added GPU detection logging with installation guidance
- Added warning when nvidia-smi detects GPUs but PyTorch doesn't
- Provided installation command: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124`

#### 3. ✅ Worker Count Optimization
**Problem:** Only using 4 workers with 24 CPU cores available
**Root Cause:** Conservative hardware manager calculation
**Solution:**

- Added tiered approach based on CPU count and RAM
- Memory-based scaling: 6 workers for 16GB, 12 for 32GB, full for 32GB+

#### 4. ✅ Button Text Visibility Issue
**Problem:** Blank button text due to styling conflicts
**Root Cause:** CSS color conflicts making text invisible
**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive CSS styling for all button types
- Fixed text color with `!important` declarations
- Improved button hover effects and visual feedback
- Added gradient styling for primary buttons

#### 5. ✅ UI/UX Improvements
**Problem:** Poor expander behavior and visual design
**Root Cause:** Default Streamlit styling not following best practices
**Solution:**
- Added smooth animations for expander content (`fadeIn` animation)
- Improved visual feedback with hover effects
- Added emoji icons for better visual hierarchy
- Enhanced color scheme and spacing
- Added GPU availability hints when applicable
