## Current Status Summary

### Planning Metrics
- **Lines of Code Analyzed:** 3,151 lines across 4 core files
- **Components Identified:** 10 total (6 new, 4 modified)
- **Creative Phases Required:** 3 phases for design decisions
- **Implementation Phases:** 5 phases total
- **Estimated Timeline:** 10-15 days complete implementation

### Key Findings from Analysis
1. **CLI Structure:** Well-organized but verbose output reduces UX
2. **Help System:** Comprehensive but overwhelming for beginners
3. **File Naming:** Missing PDBID integration in output files
4. **FAIR Compliance:** Significant gaps in metadata and standards
5. **Architecture:** Strong foundation supports planned enhancements

### Creative Phases Identified for Next Mode

#### 1. CLI UX Design Creative Phase
- **Focus:** Command-line interaction patterns and user experience design
- **Deliverables:** UX wireframes, interaction patterns, verbosity controls
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 day

#### 2. Help System Information Architecture Creative Phase
- **Focus:** Progressive disclosure and help content organization
- **Deliverables:** Help hierarchy, content organization, context mapping
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 day

#### 3. FAIR Architecture Design Creative Phase
- **Focus:** Scientific data compliance and metadata standards architecture
- **Deliverables:** FAIR compliance framework, metadata schema, integration patterns
- **Estimated Duration:** 1 day

## Next Steps - CREATIVE Mode Ready

### Immediate Next Actions
1. **Enter CREATIVE Mode** for design phase execution
2. **Execute Creative Phase 1:** CLI UX Design
3. **Execute Creative Phase 2:** Help System Information Architecture  
4. **Execute Creative Phase 3:** FAIR Architecture Design
5. **Transition to IMPLEMENT Mode** after creative phases complete

### Files Ready for Creative Phase Documentation
- `memory-bank/creative/creative-cli-ux.md` (to be created)
- `memory-bank/creative/creative-help-system.md` (to be created)
- `memory-bank/creative/creative-fair-architecture.md` (to be created)

## Implementation Readiness Status

### Ready for Implementation (Post-Creative)
- **Output Management & File Naming:** Straightforward technical implementation
- **Web Interface FAIR Integration:** Follows FAIR architecture decisions

### Requires Creative Design First
- **CLI UX Enhancement:** Needs interaction pattern design
- **Help System Redesign:** Needs information architecture decisions
- **FAIR Implementation:** Needs comprehensive architectural design
