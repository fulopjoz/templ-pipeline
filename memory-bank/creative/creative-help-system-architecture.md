# Creative Phase: Help System Information Architecture

## 🎨🎨🎨 CREATIVE PHASE COMPLETE

**Component:** Help System Information Architecture  
**Type:** Information Architecture  
**Status:** Complete  
**Date:** 2025-01-23

## Component Description

Redesign the help system architecture to implement progressive disclosure and context-sensitive assistance. Currently, the help system is comprehensive but overwhelming, presenting all information at once without considering user experience levels or specific contexts.

## Requirements & Constraints

### Requirements
- Implement tiered help with progressive disclosure (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
- Provide context-sensitive help for each command and argument
- Create quick reference cards for common workflows
- Maintain comprehensive documentation access
- Enable example-driven learning
- Support both interactive and scriptable help access

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing argparse help system
- Cannot remove existing comprehensive help (for backward compatibility)
- Must work in both CLI and potential web contexts
- Should leverage existing help content where possible
- Must be maintainable as new features are added

## Design Options Analyzed

### Option 1: Layered Help System
**Approach:** Multiple help levels accessible via flags
- `templ -h` → Basic help (common commands)
- `templ -hh` → Intermediate help (more options)
- `templ -hhh` → Advanced help (all options)
- `templ command -h` → Command-specific help

**Pros:** Simple to understand and implement, clear separation
**Cons:** Requires knowledge of levels, may fragment information

### Option 2: Interactive Help Navigator
**Approach:** Dynamic help system with navigation
- Interactive menu system for help exploration
- Topic-based navigation (workflows, commands, troubleshooting)
- Search functionality within help content
- Contextual suggestions based on current command

**Pros:** Highly discoverable, excellent for exploration
**Cons:** Complex to implement, may be slower for experienced users

### Option 3: Smart Contextual Help
**Approach:** Context-aware help that adapts to user situation
- Analyzes current command context to provide relevant help
- Shows examples specific to current arguments
- Progressive revelation based on argument complexity
- Error-driven help suggestions

**Pros:** Most relevant help at the right time, reduces cognitive load
**Cons:** Complex logic, may miss some scenarios

### Option 4: Topic-Centered Help Architecture ⭐ SELECTED (with Smart Contextual)
**Approach:** Organize help around user goals and workflows
- Workflow-based help (e.g., "Running a basic analysis")
- Command reference section (complete technical details)
- Troubleshooting guides by problem type
- Quick start guides with copy-paste examples

**Pros:** Matches user mental models, excellent for both learning and reference
**Cons:** Requires content reorganization, may duplicate information

## Selected Approach: Hybrid Topic-Centered + Smart Contextual

### Justification
- Combines the maintainability of topic-centered organization with the relevance of contextual help
- Provides multiple access patterns for different user needs
- Scalable architecture that can evolve with the project
- Balances immediate usability with long-term sustainability

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Help Content Organization Structure

```
Help Architecture:
├── Quick Start
│   ├── First Run Guide (5-minute setup)
│   ├── Common Workflows (copy-paste examples)
│   └── Essential Commands (most-used subset)
├── Workflow Guides
│   ├── Basic Pose Prediction
│   ├── Batch Processing
│   ├── Custom Parameters
│   └── Advanced Workflows
├── Command Reference
│   ├── Grouped by functionality
│   ├── Full parameter details
│   └── Technical specifications
├── Troubleshooting
│   ├── Common Errors
│   ├── Performance Issues
│   └── Installation Problems
└── Examples Library
    ├── By Use Case
    ├── By Complexity Level
    └── By Data Type
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Implementation

**Level 1 - Essential Help (Default `templ -h`)**
```
TEMPL Pipeline - Template-based Protein Ligand Pose Prediction

Quick Start:
  templ run-simple <smiles> <pdb_id>     # Basic pose prediction
  templ run <ligand.sdf> <protein.pdb>   # Full workflow

Common Commands:
  run         Predict ligand poses
  benchmark   Run benchmark evaluation
  ui          Launch web interface

Need more help?
  templ -hh           # Detailed help
  templ <cmd> -h      # Command-specific help
  templ examples      # Show examples
```

**Level 2 - Detailed Help (`templ -hh`)**
- Includes all commands with brief descriptions
- Parameter groups with common options
- Links to workflow guides

**Level 3 - Complete Help (`templ -hhh` or `templ help full`)**
- Complete technical reference
- All parameters and options
- Advanced configuration details

### 3. Context-Sensitive Help System

**Smart Help Engine (`help_engine.py`)**
```python
class SmartHelpEngine:
    def get_contextual_help(self, command, partial_args, error_context=None):
        # Analyze current context
        # Return relevant help sections
        # Include specific examples for current situation
        pass
    
    def suggest_next_steps(self, completed_command):
        # Suggest logical next commands
        # Show related workflows
        pass
```

### 4. Example-Driven Help Content

**Interactive Examples System**
- Copy-paste ready commands for common scenarios
- Progressive examples (simple → complex)
- Real data examples with expected outputs
- Error scenario examples with solutions

### 5. Help Content Management

**Content Structure (`help_content/`)**
```
help_content/
├── quick_start/
├── workflows/
├── commands/
├── troubleshooting/
├── examples/
└── templates/
```

**Dynamic Help Generation**
- Template-based help generation
- Automatic command documentation extraction
- Version-specific help content
- Localization support framework

### 6. Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Core Architecture**
- Implement topic-centered content organization
- Create basic progressive disclosure (3 help levels)
- Migrate existing help content to new structure

**Phase 2: Context Intelligence**
- Add smart contextual help suggestions
- Implement error-driven help
- Create dynamic example generation

**Phase 3: Interactive Features**
- Add help search functionality
- Implement interactive help navigation
- Create guided workflow helpers

**Phase 4: Advanced Features**
- Add personalized help recommendations
- Implement usage analytics for help improvement
- Create community-contributed examples system

## Verification Checkpoint

### Success Criteria
✅ New users can find relevant help within 30 seconds
✅ Experienced users can access complete reference quickly
✅ Context-sensitive help reduces trial-and-error cycles
✅ Help content is maintainable and extensible
✅ Examples work out-of-the-box for users

### Testing Approach
- User experience testing with help-seeking scenarios
- Content accuracy and completeness validation
- Help system performance testing
- Maintenance workflow validation

## Integration Points

### Files to Create/Modify
- `templ_pipeline/cli/help_system.py` - Enhanced help system
- `templ_pipeline/cli/help_progressive.py` - New progressive help module
- `templ_pipeline/cli/help_engine.py` - Smart contextual help engine
- `help_content/` - New content directory structure

### Content Migration Strategy
- Audit existing help content and organization
- Map current content to new topic-centered structure
- Create progressive disclosure levels for each topic
- Develop example library from existing documentation

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing `--help` behavior as fallback
- Preserve all current help content
- Add new features as enhancements, not replacements

## Implementation Dependencies
- Enhanced argparse integration
- Content management system
