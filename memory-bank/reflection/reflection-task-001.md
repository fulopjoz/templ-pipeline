   - **Outcome**: Professional loading experience that eliminates all background issues

### Design Challenges
1. **Text-Only Requirement**
   - **Challenge**: User requested no emojis, requiring alternative visual distinction
   - **Solution**: Implemented uppercase styling with enhanced typography and spacing
   - **Outcome**: Professional appearance suitable for scientific research tools

2. **Brand Consistency**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining existing glassmorphism theme while adding new components
   - **Solution**: Used existing `COLORS` constants and extended glassmorphism patterns
   - **Outcome**: Perfect visual integration with existing TEMPL design language

### Process Challenges
1. **Complex Requirements Integration**
   - **Challenge**: Three distinct requirements needing coordinated solution
   - **Solution**: Phased implementation approach addressing each requirement systematically
