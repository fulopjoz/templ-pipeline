# System Patterns - TEMPL Pipeline

## Architecture Patterns

### Template-Based Prediction Pattern
```
Input Ligand → MCS Alignment → Template Selection → Pose Generation → Scoring → Output Poses
```
- Leverages existing protein-ligand complexes as templates
- Uses maximum common substructure for alignment
- Generates constrained conformers based on template

### Pipeline Architecture Pattern
```
CLI Interface → Core Engine → Processing Modules → Output Handlers
```
- Modular design for easy extension
- Clear separation between interface and logic
- Pluggable components for different algorithms

### Hardware Adaptive Pattern
```
System Detection → Dependency Selection → Optimal Installation → Runtime Configuration
```
- Automatic hardware detection (CPU cores, RAM, GPU)
- Conditional dependency installation
- Runtime optimization based on available resources

## Code Organization Patterns

### Domain-Driven Structure
```
templ_pipeline/
├── cli/           # Command-line interface
├── core/          # Core algorithms
├── processing/    # Data processing modules
├── benchmarks/    # Evaluation framework
├── web/           # Streamlit interface
└── utils/         # Shared utilities
```

### Configuration Management Pattern
- pyproject.toml for project metadata
- Optional dependencies for different use cases
- Environment-based configuration
- Hardware-adaptive settings

### Data Flow Pattern
```
Input → Validation → Processing → Template Matching → Pose Generation → Scoring → Output
```
- Clear data transformations at each step
- Validation at entry points
- Immutable data structures where possible

## Integration Patterns

### Database Integration Pattern
- PDBbind as primary template source
- Polaris for benchmarking data
- Local caching for performance
- Lazy loading of large datasets

### Benchmark Integration Pattern
- Standardized evaluation metrics
- Reproducible test sets
- Time-split validation
- Cross-validation frameworks

### Web Interface Pattern
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Real-time progress updates
- Interactive 3D visualization
- Download results as SDF

## Error Handling Patterns

### Graceful Degradation
- CPU fallback when GPU unavailable
- Reduced functionality with missing dependencies
- Clear error messages with suggested fixes

### Validation Pattern
- Input validation at entry points
- File format verification
- Chemical structure validation
- Template availability checks

## Performance Patterns

### Parallel Processing
- Multi-worker conformer generation
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Asynchronous I/O operations
- Memory-efficient data structures

### Caching Strategy
- Template database caching
- Computed embeddings storage
- Result memoization
- LRU cache for frequent operations

## Testing Patterns

### Layered Testing
- Unit tests for core algorithms
- Integration tests for pipelines
- Performance benchmarks
- End-to-end validation

### Data-Driven Testing
- Known good test cases
- Regression test suites
- Property-based testing
- Benchmark reproducibility tests
