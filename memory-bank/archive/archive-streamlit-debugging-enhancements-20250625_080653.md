## Critical Bug Resolution: Streamlit Black Page Issue

### Problem Analysis
The TEMPL Pipeline Streamlit web application was experiencing a critical failure where:
- App started successfully (showed URLs)
- Server responded with HTTP 200
- Browser displayed only a black page
- No interface elements were visible

### Root Cause Discovery
Through systematic debugging, identified the issue as **missing `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard**:

**Original Problematic Code:**
```python
# Call main function directly for Streamlit
main()
```

**Fixed Code:**
```python
# Call main function only when run directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Technical Resolution
1. **Import Behavior Fix**: Prevented `main()` from executing during module import
2. **Streamlit Compatibility**: Ensured proper execution context for Streamlit framework
3. **Cache Management**: Cleared Python bytecode cache to resolve variable reference issues

### Verification Results
- ✅ App starts cleanly without errors
- ✅ Full interface loads correctly
- ✅ All functionality restored
- ✅ No performance degradation

## Scientific Accuracy Enhancement: AI Terminology Correction

### Problem Identification
The codebase contained misleading references to "AI features" when describing computational chemistry methods that use pre-computed embeddings, not AI inference.

### Comprehensive Terminology Updates

**Variable Renaming:**
- `AI_AVAILABLE` → `EMBEDDING_FEATURES_AVAILABLE`
- `check_ai_requirements_for_feature()` → `check_embedding_requirements_for_feature()`

**UI Text Corrections:**
- "AI Capabilities" → "Embedding Features"
- "AI features available" → "Protein embedding similarity available"
- "AI dependencies" → "ESM2 embedding dependencies"

**Log Message Accuracy:**
- "AI features available" → "Protein embedding similarity available"
- "Install AI dependencies" → "Install embedding computation dependencies"

### Scientific Impact
- **User Understanding**: Clear distinction between embeddings and AI inference
- **Technical Accuracy**: Correctly describes ESM2 embeddings and cosine similarity
- **Credibility**: Professional scientific terminology throughout

## Application Stability: Threading Architecture Fix

### Threading Conflict Resolution
Identified and resolved nested ThreadPoolExecutor conflicts causing pipeline failures:

**Problem:** Nested threading architecture
```python
# Problematic: Outer async wrapper + inner pipeline threading
poses = asyncio.run(run_pipeline_async(...))
```

**Solution:** Direct pipeline execution
```python
# Clean: Direct call using pipeline's internal threading
poses = run_pipeline(...)
```

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Eliminated "cannot schedule new futures after interpreter shutdown" errors
- ✅ Reduced "missing ScriptRunContext" warnings
- ✅ Simplified architecture without performance loss
- ✅ Improved maintainability
