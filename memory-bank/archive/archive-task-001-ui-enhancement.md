## üìã Complete Requirements Fulfillment

### Requirement 1: Background Greying Issue ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED
**Problem**: Unappealing grey background during prediction processing
**Solution**: Professional loading overlay with full-screen blur coverage
**Implementation**:
- `position: fixed` with full viewport coverage (`top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;`)
- `z-index: 9999` ensures overlay appears above all content
- `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` creates professional blur effect
- `background: rgba(30, 32, 48, 0.95)` provides professional dark background
- Scientific progress indicators with step visualization
- Smooth fade-in/out animations with GPU acceleration

**User Impact**: Transforms unappealing grey background into engaging, professional loading experience that provides useful feedback about prediction progress.

### Requirement 2: Manual Result Access ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED
**Problem**: Users must manually click Results tab after prediction completion
**Solution**: Automatic Results tab switching with session state management
**Implementation**:
- `prediction_just_completed` flag triggers automatic tab switching
- Session state management preserves user preferences
- `selected_tab_index` controls which tab is active
- Error handling ensures graceful behavior in all scenarios
- User override capability maintains manual control when needed

**User Impact**: Eliminates manual tab clicking, creating seamless workflow from prediction to results viewing with significant efficiency improvement.

### Requirement 3: Tab Visibility ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED
**Problem**: "NEW PREDICTION" and "RESULTS" tabs too small and not prominent
**Solution**: Enhanced tab styling with 40% size increase and professional appearance
**Implementation**:
- Font size increased to `1.4rem` (40% larger than default ~1rem)
- `text-transform: uppercase` with `letter-spacing: 0.5px` for professional appearance
- Enhanced padding: `1rem vertical, 2rem horizontal` for better visual presence
- Text-only approach (NO EMOJIS) per user requirement
- Glassmorphism styling consistent with existing TEMPL brand
- Hover effects with `transform: translateY(-1px)` and enhanced shadows
- High contrast accessibility with proper focus indicators

**User Impact**: Dramatically improved tab visibility and usability with professional scientific appearance appropriate for research tools.
