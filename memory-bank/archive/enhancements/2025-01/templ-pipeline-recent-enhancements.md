- Preserve 100% backward compatibility

## Implementation Details

### 1. Scientific Terminology Correction
**Approach**: Systematic replacement of misleading AI terminology with accurate scientific descriptions

**Key Changes**:
- Variable renaming: `AI_AVAILABLE` → `EMBEDDING_FEATURES_AVAILABLE`
- Function updates: `check_ai_requirements_for_feature()` → `check_embedding_requirements_for_feature()`
- UI text corrections: "AI Capabilities" → "Embedding Features"
- Log message accuracy: "AI features available" → "Protein embedding similarity available"
- Hardware descriptions: "AI features" → "embedding features"

**Scientific Basis**: Based on project brief analysis showing pipeline uses ESM2 protein embeddings (pre-computed sequence representations) and template-based pose prediction, not AI inference.

### 2. Threading Architecture Fix
**Approach**: Remove unnecessary async wrapper causing nested ThreadPoolExecutor conflicts

**Key Changes**:
- Removed `run_pipeline_async()` function entirely
- Updated main function to call `run_pipeline()` directly  
- Cleaned up unused `asyncio` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` imports
- Maintained pipeline's internal threading for parallel processing

**Technical Insight**: TEMPLPipeline already implements optimal internal threading; additional async wrapper created conflicts during scoring phase.

### 3. Application Startup Resolution
**Approach**: Systematic debugging and cache management to resolve display issues

**Key Changes**:
- Removed problematic `@time_function` decorator from main() function
- Fixed Streamlit app structure (removed `if __name__ == "__main__":` block)
- Cleared Python bytecode cache to resolve variable reference conflicts
- Ensured proper session state initialization timing

**Root Cause**: Python cache persistence retained old variable names despite source code updates, causing import-time failures.

## Testing Performed

### Scientific Accuracy Verification
- **Import validation**: All modules import successfully without syntax errors
- **Log message verification**: Confirmed accurate "Protein embedding similarity available" message  
- **UI terminology check**: Verified all user-facing text uses correct scientific terminology
- **Functionality preservation**: All embedding features work exactly as before

### Application Stability Testing
- **Threading conflict resolution**: Pipeline completes successfully without "cannot schedule new futures" errors
- **Startup verification**: Streamlit application starts cleanly without crashes
- **HTTP response testing**: Server returns 200 OK with proper content
- **Process monitoring**: Stable execution without threading-related warnings

### User Experience Validation
- **Interface rendering**: Full TEMPL Pipeline interface displays correctly
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, accessible text-based interface confirmed
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved without regressions
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works reliably across different browser environments

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- **Threading architecture**: Direct function calls work better than async wrappers in Streamlit context
- **Python cache behavior**: Bytecode cache can persist old variable references, requiring manual clearing after significant refactoring
- **Scientific communication**: Using precise technical terminology improves user trust and understanding

### Process Improvements
- **Systematic debugging**: Working through potential causes methodically more effective than random testing
- **Terminology consistency**: Having clear replacement strategy prevents inconsistent updates
- **Cache management**: Establish standard procedure for clearing Python cache after variable renaming

### Quality Assurance
- **Import testing**: Simple import validation quickly confirms fixes
- **Documentation value**: Detailed problem analysis helps track solutions
- **Verification thoroughness**: Comprehensive testing prevents regressions
