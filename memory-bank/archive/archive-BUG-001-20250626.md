# Enhancement Archive: Template Molecule 2D Visualization Connectivity Fix

## Date Completed
2024-06-26

## Task Summary
**Task ID**: BUG-001  
**Type**: Bug Fix - Template Molecule 2D Visualization Connectivity  
**Complexity Level**: 2 (Simple Enhancement/Bug Fix)  
**Status**: COMPLETED & ARCHIVED

## Problem Description
The 2D visualization of template molecules in the web UI was showing disrupted connectivity. The molecular structure appeared malformed with broken bonds or incorrect atom connections.

## Root Cause Analysis
**ROOT CAUSE**: Coordinate manipulation in `mcs.py` corrupted molecular state without proper sanitization, leading to visualization connectivity issues.

## Key Files Modified
- `templ_pipeline/core/mcs.py` - Added sanitization after coordinate transformations
- `templ_pipeline/ui/app.py` - Implemented smart fallback logic for visualization

## Implementation Details
**Smart Solution**: Dual-track molecule handling
- **Track 1**: Transformed molecules with correct 3D coordinates for pose prediction
- **Track 2**: Original molecular structure preserved via SMILES for visualization

**Key Changes**:
1. Added molecular sanitization after coordinate transformation in `transform_ligand()`
2. Added sanitization after `rdMolAlign.AlignMol()` calls in `constrained_embed()`  
3. Added sanitization after coordinate translation in `central_atom_embed()`
4. Updated visualization functions with smart fallback to original structure

## Testing Performed
- QA validation passed all technical checks
- Core module imports and functionality verified
- All modified functions confirmed present and functional

## Lessons Learned
- Direct coordinate manipulation can corrupt RDKit molecular state
- Separation of 3D coordinates and 2D connectivity is key for molecular visualization
- Proper sanitization points are critical after molecular transformations
