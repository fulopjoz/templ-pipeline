## 1. Feature Overview

### üéØ **Purpose & Context**
This Level 3 intermediate feature resolved critical user confusion about temporary folder management in the TEMPL Pipeline and implemented a comprehensive unified workspace management system. The feature addressed scattered file management patterns between UI and CLI interfaces, establishing professional-grade file lifecycle management with clear separation of temporary and persistent files.

### üìã **Original Problem Statement**
Users were confused by terminology and inconsistent file management:
- **"What does it mean that temp folder is in the run?"** - Users misunderstood TEMPLPipeline output directories as temp folders
- **"What is created in temp folders?"** - No clear organization of temporary processing files
- **"Should they be together in one run or not?"** - Unclear whether to unify or separate temporary and persistent files
- **"Why keep temp folder when deleting files?"** - Confusion about directory structure vs file lifecycle management
- **Cross-Platform Inconsistency** - Different temporary file handling between UI (SecureFileUploadHandler) and CLI (simple output dirs)

### üéØ **Feature Scope**
Implemented comprehensive unified workspace management with:
- Clear workspace structure per run with timestamped directories
- Intelligent file lifecycle management with category-based organization
- Cross-platform consistency between UI and CLI interfaces
- Enhanced metadata generation with workspace context
- Comprehensive file tracking and cleanup policies

## 3. Design Decisions & Creative Outputs

### üé® **Creative Phase Analysis**
The creative phase was **foundational** to this feature's success, conducted through sequential thinking analysis that uncovered the core terminology confusion driving user problems.

#### **Critical Design Insights:**
1. **Problem Discovery** - "Temp folder in the run" actually referred to TEMPLPipeline OUTPUT directories, not temporary processing files
2. **Architecture Solution** - Unified workspace structure with clear separation: `temp/` (processing files) and `output/` (persistent results)
3. **Integration Strategy** - Comprehensive cross-platform approach ensuring UI and CLI consistency

#### **Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Workspace Structure Design:**
   ```
   workspace/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ temp/              # Temporary processing files
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploaded/      # Secure uploaded files (UI)
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processing/    # Intermediate processing files
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/         # Cache files (can be deleted)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/            # Final persistent results
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poses_final.sdf
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poses_final_metadata.json
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/              # Processing logs
   ```

2. **File Lifecycle Policies:**
   - **Temporary files**: Age-based cleanup (24h default, configurable)
   - **Output files**: Persistent unless explicitly archived
   - **Directory structure**: Preserved for debugging and consistency

3. **Integration Architecture:**
   - **Core Component**: UnifiedWorkspaceManager with comprehensive API
   - **Pipeline Integration**: Backward-compatible modification of TEMPLPipeline
   - **UI Integration**: Enhanced SecureFileUploadHandler and new UIWorkspaceIntegration utility
   - **CLI Tools**: Complete workspace management CLI with dry-run capabilities

### üìö **Style Guide Compliance**
Feature implementation followed established coding standards and architectural patterns from `memory-bank/style-guide.md`, maintaining consistency with existing TEMPL Pipeline design principles.
