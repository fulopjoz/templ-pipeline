## Current Task Overview

### Level 3 Task: TEMPL Pipeline DigitalOcean Deployment & Streamlit Black Page Fix
- **Complexity:** Intermediate Feature (deployment + debugging)
- **Priority:** HIGH (critical for production access)
- **Components:** Docker deployment, Streamlit debugging, cloud infrastructure

### Immediate Issues Identified
1. **Critical Bug:** Streamlit app shows black page despite successful startup
2. **Deployment Need:** Docker container deployment to DigitalOcean App Platform
3. **Production Readiness:** Ensure stable operation in cloud environment

## Planning Phase Status

### âœ… Completed Planning Elements
- **Requirements Analysis:** Comprehensive analysis of deployment and debugging needs
- **Technology Stack Validation:** Docker, Streamlit, DigitalOcean App Platform confirmed
- **Component Analysis:** Docker config, Streamlit app, cloud infrastructure identified
- **Implementation Strategy:** 4-phase approach defined (Debug â†’ Docker â†’ Deploy â†’ Monitor)
- **Creative Phases Identified:** UI/UX design and Architecture design required

### ðŸ”„ Current Planning Focus
- **Streamlit Black Page Issue:** Systematic debugging approach planned
- **Docker Optimization:** Build process review and cloud compatibility
- **DigitalOcean Configuration:** App Platform setup and resource planning
- **Production Validation:** Testing and monitoring strategy

## Context from User Requirements

### User's Specific Needs

3. **Production verification** - Ensure application works correctly in cloud

### Current Application Status
- **Local Development:** Application functional with previous enhancements
- **Web Interface:** FAIR metadata integration and professional appearance complete
- **Docker Configuration:** Existing Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- **Repository:** Code ready for deployment on speedrun branch

## Technical Context

### Streamlit Issue Details
- **Symptom:** App starts successfully, shows URLs, but browser displays black page
- **Environment:** Linux 6.8.0-62-generic, Streamlit 1.46.0
- **Launcher:** Using `run_streamlit_app.py` script
- **URLs Shown:** Local: http://localhost:8501, Network: http://172.16.3.219:8501, External: http://147.251.245.128:8501

### Docker Context
- **Current Dockerfile:** Multi-stage build with Git LFS support
- **Base Image:** python:3.10-slim
- **Target Port:** 8080 for cloud deployment
- **Dependencies:** 524 requirements in requirements.txt

## Next Steps (Post-Planning)

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Complete Planning Phase:** Finalize creative design decisions
2. **Enter Creative Mode:** Design debugging approach and deployment architecture
3. **Begin Implementation:** Start with critical Streamlit black page fix
4. **Progress to Deployment:** Docker optimization and DigitalOcean setup

### Success Criteria
