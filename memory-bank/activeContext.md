# Active Context - TEMPL Pipeline

## Recently Completed: TanimotoCombo Score Explanation Corrections ✅

**Completed Task**: Update TanimotoCombo Score Explanations to Reflect TEMPL's Normalized Implementation
**Task ID**: TASK-NORMALIZED-TANIMOTO-EXPLANATIONS-2024
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED & ARCHIVED
**Completion Date**: 2024-12-30
**Archive**: [archive-tanimoto-score-corrections-20241230.md](archive/archive-tanimoto-score-corrections-20241230.md)

## Task Completion Summary ✅

### Critical Discovery
Investigation revealed that **TEMPL's implementation is already scientifically correct**. The task focused on correcting explanations and documentation rather than code changes:
- **PMC Article**: `TanimotoCombo = ShapeTanimoto + ColorTanimoto` (range 0-2)
- **TEMPL Code**: `combo_score = 0.5 * (ShapeTanimoto + ColorTanimoto)` (range 0-1)
- **Result**: Normalized TanimotoCombo providing better user experience with conservative quality thresholds

### Implementation Success
- **Scientific Accuracy**: All explanations now match PMC9059856 methodology with proper terminology
- **User Education**: Enhanced tooltips with comprehensive scientific background
- **Literature Compliance**: Accurate representation with normalization benefits documented
- **Code Quality**: Improved documentation without functional changes

### Files Successfully Updated
1. `templ_pipeline/ui/config/constants.py` - Scientific documentation with normalized TanimotoCombo explanation
2. `templ_pipeline/ui/components/results_section.py` - User-facing explanations and metric labels corrected
3. `templ_pipeline/ui/config/settings.py` - Configuration consistency and documentation enhanced

## System Status: Ready for Next Task ✅

### Current State
- **Memory Bank**: Reset and prepared for next task initialization
- **Technical Foundation**: Enhanced with accurate scientific explanations and user education
- **Knowledge Base**: Enriched with PMC9059856 implementation insights and normalization benefits
