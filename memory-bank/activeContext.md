## Current Focus: Git Repository Management Implementation

**Primary Task**: Git Repository Management & Authoritative State Push
**Task ID**: TASK-GIT-MANAGEMENT-2024
**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Mode**: PLAN → IMPLEMENT (Ready for transition)

## Immediate Objective
Execute the comprehensive 4-phase Git management plan to establish current local state as authoritative version on GitHub repository.

## Context Summary
- **Current State**: UI reorganization completed locally with professional modular architecture
- **Repository Status**: Local changes need to be pushed as authoritative version (overriding 4 remote commits)
- **Strategy**: Safe force push with comprehensive commit message and backup safety measures
- **User Priority**: Current local state is definitive and must be preserved on GitHub

## Implementation Readiness ✅
- [x] Repository analysis complete
- [x] Comprehensive 4-phase plan documented
- [x] Risk mitigation strategies defined
- [x] Technology validation complete
- [x] Quality assurance checklist prepared
- [x] DevOps best practices integrated

## Phase Overview
1. **Phase 1**: Pre-Push Verification (5 min)
2. **Phase 2**: Stage All Changes (10 min)
3. **Phase 3**: Create Meaningful Commit (10 min)
4. **Phase 4**: Authoritative Push (5 min)

## Key Safety Measures
- Backup branch creation before any changes
- Use of `--force-with-lease` for safe force push
- Comprehensive commit message following conventional commits
