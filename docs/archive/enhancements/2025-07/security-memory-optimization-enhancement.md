## Problem Analysis

### Original Issues Identified
The TEMPL Pipeline Streamlit application (app.py, 2,333 lines) had several critical areas requiring optimization:

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Basic file upload validation without MIME checking
   - Error handling exposing stack traces to users
   - Missing input sanitization and path traversal protection

2. **Memory Management Issues**
   - Large molecular objects stored directly in session state
   - No automatic cleanup causing memory bloat
   - Inefficient caching leading to redundant calculations

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Repeated molecular validation without caching
   - Inefficient lazy loading patterns
   - No memory usage monitoring or optimization controls

4. **Code Organization**
   - Monolithic structure with mixed concerns
   - Limited error handling and user feedback
   - No performance monitoring capabilities

## Implementation Architecture

### Design Principles Applied
1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Optimization modules enhance experience when available, graceful fallback when not
2. **Modular Architecture**: Independent components with clean interfaces
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System functions fully with or without optimization modules
4. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
5. **User-Centric Design**: Enhanced feedback and monitoring without complexity
